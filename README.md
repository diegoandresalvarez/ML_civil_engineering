# Machine Learning in Civil Engineering
#### For the moment this repository contains four different applications of machine learning algorithms in civil engineering problems with the main focus on neural networks.
#### Description:
##### -A1_Lichefiere - Modeling soil liquefaction probability <br> -A2_Rezistenta beton - Modeling concrete axial compressive strength <br> -A3_Grinda perete - Modeling maximum shear force developed in deep beams<br> -A4_Vant LTSM - Generate values for yearly  maxima of sustained wind speeds for 10 years using LTSM recurrent networks (this is an alternative to Monte Carlo simulation, I know that stochastic processes cannot be predicted)
#### Ps. For the moment the annotations are in a foreign language, I will fix this in the future.
