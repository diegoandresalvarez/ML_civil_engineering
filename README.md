# Machine Learning in Civil Engineering
#### For the moment this repository contains four different applications of machine learning algorithms in civil engineering problems with the main focus on neural networks. The topics developed here represents an excerpt from my Master Thesis: Applications of Neural Networks in Civil Engineering. Right now I am working on a summary of my master thesis, you can check the progress here:  https://www.overleaf.com/read/yhftjnkkmqsn .

#### Ps. The code annotations are in a foreign language (_lang_RO - Romanian) and also in English (_lang_EN). The brief document is only in Romanian and I will address this issue in the future.
##### Contents:<br>- A1_Lichefiere - Modeling soil liquefaction probability <br> - A2_Rezistenta beton - Modeling concrete axial compressive strength <br> - A3_Grinda perete - Modeling maximum shear force developed in deep beams<br> - A4_Vant LTSM - Generate values for yearly  maxima of sustained wind speeds for 10 years using LTSM recurrent networks (this is an alternative to Monte Carlo simulation, I know that stochastic processes cannot be predicted :relaxed: )
